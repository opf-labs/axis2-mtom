  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.name = "axis-mtom"
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    # vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
  # Run the provisioning script
  config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "./setup.sh"
